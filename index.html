<div class="Main Paragraph">
    <h1>Who is the inventor of chocolate and making methods .</h1>
    <p>The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to 
       <b>Joseph Fry</b>, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable
       chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch 
       cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing 
       boxes of chocolate candies in England.

    <h3>About Step 1</h3>
    <p>Cocoa beans grow in pods that sprout off of the trunk and branches 
       of cocoa trees. The pods are about the size of a football. The pods 
       start out green and turn orange when they're ripe. When the pods
       are ripe, harvesters travel through the cocoa orchards with machetes 
       and hack the pods gently off of the trees.Machines could damage the 
       tree or the clusters of flowers and pods that grow from the trunk, 
       so workers must be harvest the pods by hand, using short, hooked blades 
       mounted on long poles to reach the highest fruit.After the cocoa pods are
        collected into baskets ,the pods are taken to a processing house. Here 
        they are split open and the cocoa beans are removed. Pods can contain upwards of 
        50 cocoa beans each. Fresh cocoa beans are not brown at all, they do not taste at 
        all like the sweet chocolate they will eventually produce
        </p>

    <h3>About Step 2</h3>
     <p>Now the beans undergo the fermentation processing. They are either placed in large
         , shallow, heated trays or covered with large banana leaves. If the climate is right
         , they may be simply heated by the sun. Workers come along periodically and stir them
          up so that all of the beans come out equally fermented. During fermentation is when 
          the beans turn brown. This process may take five or eight days.

    <h3>About Step 3</h3>
    <p>After fermentation, the cocoa seeds must be dried before they can be scooped into sacks 
        and shipped to chocolate manufacturers. Farmers simply spread the fermented seeds on 
        trays and leave them in the sun to dry. The drying process usually takes about a week 
        and results in seeds that are about half of their original weight.

    <h3>About Step 4</h3>
    <p>The first thing that chocolate manufacturers do with cocoa beans is roast them. This 
        develops the colour and flavour of the beans into what our modern palates expect from 
        fine chocolate.The outer shell of the beans is removed, and the inner cocoa bean meat is broken into small 
        pieces called "cocoa nibs."The roasting process makes the shells of the cocoa brittle, and 
        cocoa nibs pass through a series of sieves, which strain and sort the nibs according to size 
        in a process called "winnowing".

    <h3>About the Step 5</h3>
    <p>Grinding is the process by which cocoa nibs are ground into " cocoa liquor",
         which is also known as unsweetened chocolate or cocoa mass. The grinding process 
         generates heat and the dry granular consistency of the cocoa nib is then turned into a liquid as 
         the high amount of fat contained in the nib melts. The cocoa liquor is mixed with cocoa butter and sugar. 
         In the case of milk chocolate, fresh, sweetened condensed or roller-dry low-heat powdered whole milk is added, 
         depending on the individual manufacturer's formula and manufacturing methods.

    <h3>About Step 6</h3>

    <p><b> Milk Chocolate</b>is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa, sugar and milk. The most popular 
        form of chocolate in many countries, milk chocolate was originally sold solely as a chocolate bar but is 
        now available in a variety of forms. Major milk chocolate producers include Ferrero, Hershey, Mondelez, 
        Mars and Nestlé. Between them, they are responsible for over half of the chocolate sold worldwide. 
        Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, increasingly 
        large amounts are consumed in China and Latin America. While taste and texture have been key to its success, 
        milk chocolate has also historically been promoted as a healthy food, particularly for children.</br>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Chopped_white_chocolate_chunks.jpg/375px-Chopped_white_chocolate_chunks.jpg"></br>
        White chocolate is a chocolate confection, pale ivory in color, made from cocoa butter, sugar, milk 
        solids and sometimes vanilla. White chocolate does not contain cocoa solids, which are found in 
        other types of chocolate, such as milk chocolate and dark chocolate. It is solid at room temperature 
        25 °C (77 °F) because the melting point of cocoa butter, the only cocoa bean component of white chocolate
        , is 35 °C (95 °F)</br>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Schokolade-schwarz.jpg/300px-Schokolade-schwarz.jpg"></br>
        Dark chocolate (also known as sour chocolate) is a form of chocolate containing cocoa solids and cocoa butter, 
        without the milk or butter found in milk chocolate. Government and industry standards of what products may 
        be labeled "Dark chocolate" vary by country and market. Dark chocolate is considered more healthy than other 
        types of chocolate to which milk and larger amounts of sugar may be added, such as milk chocolate, but high-quality
         evidence for significant health benefits of chocolate, particularly the dark variety, such as on blood pressure, 
         has not been shown.</br>
